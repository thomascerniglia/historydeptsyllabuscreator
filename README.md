# History Syllabus Generator - Refactored

This project has been successfully refactored from a single 4116-line file into multiple manageable modules.

## File Structure

### Original File
- `syllabus2.py` - The original monolithic file (has been preserved for reference)

### Refactored Files

1. **`main.py`** - Main application entry point
   - Contains the `HistorySyllabusGenerator` class
   - Handles application initialization and main loop
   - Coordinates between all other modules

2. **`constants.py`** - All default text constants and policies
   - Course description defaults
   - Policy text templates
   - General education text
   - Recording policy defaults

3. **`templates.py`** - Template system
   - `SyllabusTemplate` class definition
   - `load_default_templates()` function
   - AMH2010/AMH2020 course templates

4. **`ui_tabs.py`** - User interface components
   - `UITabsMixin` class with all tab creation methods
   - Course info tab, instructor tab, schedule tab, etc.
   - All UI-related functionality

5. **`document_generation.py`** - Document creation logic
   - `DocumentGenerationMixin` class
   - Word document generation methods
   - PDF conversion functionality
   - Hyperlink and formatting utilities

6. **`test_imports.py`** - Import verification script
   - Tests that all modules import correctly
   - Useful for debugging import issues

## Key Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability** - Each file has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Readability** - Much easier to navigate and understand
3. **Debugging** - Issues can be isolated to specific modules
4. **Extensibility** - New features can be added to appropriate modules
5. **Reusability** - Components can be reused in other projects

## Usage

Run the application with:
```bash
python main.py
```

Test imports with:
```bash
python test_imports.py
```

## Preserved Functionality

All original functionality has been preserved exactly as-is:
- Complete UI with all tabs and controls
- Template loading and management
- Document generation (Word and PDF)
- All policy options and configurations
- Hyperlink creation and formatting
- Error handling and validation

## Architecture

The refactored application uses a mixin-based architecture:
- `HistorySyllabusGenerator` inherits from `UITabsMixin` and `DocumentGenerationMixin`
- This allows clean separation of concerns while maintaining all functionality
- Constants and templates are imported as needed

## No Breaking Changes

The refactoring was designed to be completely transparent:
- No changes to user interface or behavior
- No changes to document output format
- No changes to file formats or data structures
- All existing functionality works exactly as before
